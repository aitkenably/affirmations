	"I am disciplined. Discipline begets discipline. Discipline is freedom.",
	"I am always running experiments. On my behavior. On my tools. Discarding an approach or idea is not failure. It's evolution.",
	"I am not listening to anxiety. She lies.",
	"I am not heeding anger. Anger is a secondary emotion.",
	"I am not worried about the flood. Ships don't sink because of the water around them. They sink because of the water that gets in them.", 
	"I am looking to others for their strengths. The best way to solve a problem is not a 'how'Â but a 'who'.",
	"I am a tree. A tree does not think to compete with the other trees of the forest. It just grows tall.",
	"I am the reason that someone believes in the goodness of other people.",
	"I am quieter, so I may hear more.",
	"I am not rigidly defined by temporary, fleeting states of mind. Being anxious in a particular moment doesn't make me an anxious person.", 
	"I am going inward, because the solutions are not outside of me.",
	"I am mindfully noticing my behavior, so that habitual thoughts and patterns do not dominate me."
